    <h2>Description:</h2>
    
    <p>If you happen to spend Christmas Eve in Canada — especially Quebec — you might be lucky enough to be invited to a festive dinner after midnight Mass. The feast is an old tradition from France called reveillon, and it's something to look forward to after a long day of fasting.</p>

    <p>"They'll have a huge feast, with sweets and lobster and oysters, everything," says Thomas Naylor, executive chef to the Canadian ambassador to the U.S. "But in Quebec, at least, you'll always have tourtiere. It will be the center of the reveillon."</p>

    <p>Naylor knows about this Christmas Eve custom because many years ago, it traveled with French emigres across the Atlantic to Canada (and to New Orleans). The tourtiere is a savory, spiced meat pie, which both French- and English-speaking Canadians love to serve around the holidays. (For more on the history of pie, see Alison Richards' recent story.)</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>5 cups water</li>
      <li>5 pounds lean ground pork</li>
      <li>3 onions, chopped</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons salt</li>
      <li>2½ cups ground dry bread crumbs, or more as needed</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
      <li>5 pastries for double-crust pies</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring water to a boil in a large saucepan; crumble pork into the boiling water. Reduce heat and simmer until pork is no longer pink, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain water into a large bowl and transfer pork to a separate bowl; refrigerate pork. Refrigerate broth until fat separates from water, at least 1 hour.</li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Place pork in a large skillet; add onions and salt. Cook and stir pork mixture over medium heat until onion is soft and translucent, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>Skim and discard the fat from the broth. Pour the remaining broth over the pork-onion mixture; stir in bread crumbs and allspice until well mixed. Add more bread crumbs if mixture is runny. Remove skillet from heat.</li>
      <li>Press 5 pie crusts into five 9-inch pie dishes. Divide ground pork mixture among the 5 prepared pie crusts. Place 1 pie crust over each pie, crimping edges together to seal. Cut slits into the top crust of each pie for ventilation.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until pies are golden brown, about 1 hour.</li>
    </ol>
