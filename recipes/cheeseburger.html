  	<h2>Description:</h2>
  	<p>The All-American Cheeseburger has certain non-negotiable elements: American cheese is one of them. Rather than unwrap individual singles, get sliced cheese from your nearest deli counter - it tastes better and melts slower and more evenly. Dill pickle chips, sliced red onion and tomato, crisp lettuce leaves, ketchup and mayo are also involved. You can mix even the two condiments together along with some chopped pickles for Thousand Island dressing, a burger favorite, and it'll still be an All-American Cheeseburger worth Instagramming .</p>
  	<p>Serve these burgers on homemade buns, for the love of all things sacred. It would be a shame to serve something this beautiful on anything less.</p>

  	<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  	<ul>
  	  <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
  	  <li>½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
  	  <li>½ cup bacon bits</li>
  	  <li>2 tablespoons prepared horseradish</li>
  	  <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
  	  <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
  	  <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
  	  <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
  	</ul>

  	<h2>Steps:</h2>
  	<ol>
  	  <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
  	  <li>Mix ground beef, Cheddar cheese, bacon bits, horseradish, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Divide beef mixture into 4 equal parts and shape into patties.</li>
  	  <li>Grill on the preheated grill until patties are no longer pink in the center, 5 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C) for well-done.</li>
  	  <li>Serve patties with hamburger buns.</li>
  	</ol>
